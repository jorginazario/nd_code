My program from part 3 is meant to compute the dot product of two vectors. I learned this 
computation in Calculus III to search for the directional growth of one vector to another. 
From the programmer's perspective, the  program is structured into three parts: define 
variables, request input for variable values, and compute dot product with formula. After 
testing the program I corroborated that the program was correct by doing the arithmetic 
myself.

From the user's perspective, this program is meant to manage a list of sayings. 
The user can add new sayings to his list, search for specific sayings by word search, 
save all his sayings into another text file, and obviously display the entire list 
of sayings  when commanded. The pogram is structured the following way: the four 
different functions of the program are declared, main function is declared, and in 
it all the variable are initialized, then the program starts by prompting the user 
for a filename to work with, and finally all the functions are called inside a while 
loop that exits only when the option 5 is chosen. I verified that the program was correct
by checking for each and every function individually every time I finished it up. Instead of 
having to debug all four functions at the same time I debugged one at a time. For the function 
that added a new saying, I verified correctness by running the display function to see if 
the new saying was being added to the list correctly. Similarly, I verified the other functions 
by looking at the original list after running each command and comparing it to the output to make 
sure it was display the correct results.

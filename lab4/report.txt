The last program, from the user perspective, displays a set of options a user 
can choose from. These options permit him to choose if he would like to see 
the years Notre Dame football has won more than a certain amount of games 
or how many times Notre Dame has lost a minimum amount of games, etc.

Internally, the program functions in a while loop where if the option 6 (to exi) is 
not selected it will keep runnning. If the option to "display the years with the
minimum 'n' amount of losses" is chosen, then the if statement for that choice
will prompt the user to select the minimum amount 'n' and then it will check all 
years and compare the minimum value 'n' of losses with the losses of the year
inside a for loop (to check all the years). 

ALl the options are fairly simple and striaght forward and work as the one explained
above. Their differences will be in the if statements inside the for loops to see what 
will be checked in each array of the wins and losses each time.

I verified that the output of the program was correct by checking in the list given with all the records.
After I corroborated the first five and last five years' scores with the what the program was displaying,
I knew it was functioning well.
